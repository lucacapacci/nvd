The vulnerable component is Evope.Service.exe, which runs with SYSTEM privileges and automatically loads the DLL on startup or reboot."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://www.evope.tech/", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "https://xavilok.es/dll-hijacking-in-evopeservice--system-to-gui-shell", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}]}}
