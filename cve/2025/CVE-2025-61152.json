A malicious actor can craft a forged token with arbitrary claims (e.g., is_admin=true) and bypass authentication checks, leading to privilege escalation or unauthorized access in applications that rely on python-jose for token validation. This issue is exploitable unless developers explicitly reject 'alg=none' tokens, which is not enforced by the library."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://github.com/javiermorales36/PoC-for-python-jose-alg-none-JWT-bypass-vulnerability/blob/main/CVE-2025-61152_Security_Advisory.md", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "https://pypi.org/project/python-jose", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}]}}
