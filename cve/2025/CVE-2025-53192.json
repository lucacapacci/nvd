Users are recommended to find an alternative or restrict access to the instance to trusted users.\n\n\nNOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer."}], "metrics": {}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "security@apache.org", "type": "Primary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-146"}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/2gj8tjl6vz949nnp3yxz3okm9xz2k7sp", "source": "security@apache.org"}]}}
