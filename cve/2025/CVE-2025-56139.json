As a result, the stale preview remains visible while the clickable link points to a different URL, which can be malicious. This UI misrepresentation enables attackers to deceive users by displaying trusted previews for harmful links, facilitating phishing attacks and user confusion."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://hdhrmi.blogspot.com/2025/07/aiman-al-hadhrami-linkedin-vulnerability.html", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "https://hdhrmi.blogspot.com/2025/09/link-preview-mismatch-cve-2025-56139.html", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}]}}
