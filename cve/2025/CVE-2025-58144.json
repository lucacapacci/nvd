A NULL pointer de-reference could result on a release\nbuild.  This is CVE-2025-58144.\n\nAnd then the P2M lock isn't held until a page reference was actually\nobtained (or the attempt to do so has failed).  Otherwise the page can\nnot only change type, but even ownership in between, thus allowing\ndomain boundaries to be violated.
