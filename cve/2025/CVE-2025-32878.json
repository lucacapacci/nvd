It implements a function to connect the watch to a WLAN. This function is mainly for downloading firmware files. Before downloading firmware files, the watch requests some information about the firmware via HTTPS from the back-end API. However, the X.509 server certificate within the TLS handshake is not validated by the device. This allows an attacker within an active machine-in-the-middle position, using a TLS proxy and a self-signed certificate, to eavesdrop and manipulate the HTTPS communication. This could be abused, for example, for stealing the API access token of the assigned user account."}], "metrics": {}, "references": [{"url": "https://support.coros.com/hc/en-us/articles/20087694119828-COROS-PACE-3-Release-Notes", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "https://syss.de", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "https://www.syss.de/fileadmin/dokumente/Publikationen/Advisories/SYSS-2025-030.txt", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}]}}
